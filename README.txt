Populations
------------------
Populations is a fun program that creates a completely made up and extensive family tree in seconds!
No dependencies - simply run app.py with Python 3.10.

How it works:
----------------
When you run app.py, you will be prompted with some inputs to customise your generated family.
Fill out these using appropriate inputs and away it will go!

If you have created a very large family tree this may take some time, but eventually it will create a text file called:
'result.txt'

This result file is your family tree encoded in a FamilyScript format.
This is then usable on the FamilyEcho website:
1 - Navigate to: https://familyecho.com/#
2 - Look to the bottom left of the interface for 'Import GEDCOM or FamilyScript'
3 - Click 'Choose File'
4 - Choose the result.txt file the program created
And voila! Your very own completely randomised family tree.
